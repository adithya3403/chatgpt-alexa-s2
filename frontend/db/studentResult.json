Improved code organization: Encapsulation helps to organize the code and class members by grouping related variables and functions into one unit. This makes the code easier to read and maintain.2. Increased security: Encapsulation helps to protect the data from outside interference and misuse by restricting access to the class members.3. Improved reusability: Encapsulation makes it easier to reuse code by allowing the same code to be used in different contexts.4. Improved maintainability: Encapsulation makes it easier to maintain code by allowing changes to be made in one place without affecting the rest of the code.5. Improved extensibility: Encapsulation makes it easier to extend the functionality of a class by allowing new features to be added without affecting the existing code.","studentAns":"the benefits of encapsulation are data security and protection","rating":"9"}
